#1 To run this software you will need a Erlang/Python interface called ErlPort.
It can be downloaded from: http://erlport.org/downloads/ 
Step by step guide for isntallation:
1. Download the right file for your Erlang version (can be seen when starting the shell, the version number is next to Erlang / OTP ##)
2. Run code:lib_dir(). in the Erlang shell and you will see the directory for your Erlang library.
3. Put the folder in that directory.
4. Restart the Erlang shell and ErlPort should be working.
To test it write the following in your shell:
{ok, P} = python:start().
python:stop(P).
